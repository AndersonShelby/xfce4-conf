# xfce4-conf 🚀 - My configuration for xfce4! 💻
> Note: For now, this configuration only works in Termux, but I will soon bring portability to other distributions.

> Credits: This configuration is initially based on the work of Yisus7u7 and derived specifically from their repository termux-desktop-xfce. Over time, I have customized and adapted it to suit my own needs, but credit goes to Yisus7u7 for the original setup and inspiration.
